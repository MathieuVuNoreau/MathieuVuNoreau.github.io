                  My first four months at EA were spent learning existing infrastructure while learning how to use various software to operate the infrastructure. One of the most useful tools ive learned at my time at EA was Jenkins. Jenkins is an automation server/service. It helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

                  While learning the Infrastructure of EA, one of the tools which is highly relied upon by the organization is Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is comprised more than 90 services spanning a wide range including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. The core infrastructure tools used at EA from AWS are EC2 Instances(computing), S3 buckets (storage), Elastic Search (analytics), and AWS CloudWatch (Management). I was able to utilize all these products within AWS in order to understand and contribute to the existing EA infrastructure.

                  On the tail end of the last 4 months I was able to explore some new(ish) technologies within the DevOps/SRE world. Throughout the DevOps/SRE industry Docker is the front runner for operating system level virtualization, also known as “containerization”. I was able to utilize docker during my time at EA when I was given the opportunity to build my own internal application used to create, edit and destroy development environments.

                  For the last 4 months at EA I was able to use my existing knowledge of infrastructure and development to develop an internal tool for developers within the EAX team to use. I was able to utilize my existing front-end skills and explore React.Js for the first time. To be put simply, React.Js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is often used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

                The most interesting part of my work term at EA was the exposure to a completely different field of computing. I had never been exposed to a DevOps/SRE role which had brought on some new challenges. With the new knowledge of networking, CI/CD, and containerization I believe I am a better-rounded developer and am able to take on most/any web development challenges.
